nmf_training_01: training using coherence time of 500 mus;
nmf_training_02: training using coherence time of 100 mus;
nmf_training_03: training using coherence time of 100 mus and interference signal with larger pulses;
nmf_training_04: same as 01. This simulation is to confirm the results found in 01;
nmf_training_05: training using coherence time of 500 mus and quantisation using 2 bits;
nmf_training_06: training using coherence time of 500 mus and quantisation using 2, 4, 8, 16 bits;
nmf_training_07: training using coherence time of 500 mus and quantisation using 2, 4, 8, 16 bits (quantisation function fixed);
nmf_training_08: training using coherence time of 500 mus, error thresholds of 1e-3 and max it = 500;
nmf_training_09: training using coherence time of 500 mus, error thresholds of 1e-3 and max it = 500, quantisation bits = [2 4];
nmf_training_10: training using coherence time of 500 mus, error thresholds of 1e-3 and max it = 500, quantisation bits = [2 4] (quantisation function now saturating and using threshold according to noise variance)
