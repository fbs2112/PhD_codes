results 01: results using chirp, with gaussian kernel;
results 02: results using chirp, with gaussian kernel, variance window;
results 03: same as 01, but with inner product and a median window over the detector output;
results 04: same as 02, but with inner product and a median window over the detector output;
results 05: same as 01, but with a median window over the detector output;
results 06: same as 02, but with a median window over the detector output;
